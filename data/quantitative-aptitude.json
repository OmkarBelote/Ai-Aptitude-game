Solving: 0.05C = 2 -> C = 2/0.05 = 40. There seems to be an error in this question's explanation or options. Let's correct it: After 10L is removed, the remaining mixture is C-10. The amount of water removed is 10 * 0.20 = 2L. Remaining water = 0.2C - 2. New concentration of water = (0.2C-2) / C = 0.15. Solving: 0.2C - 2 = 0.15C -> 0.05C = 2 -> C=40. Let's update the question to make the math work better. Okay, the question is fine. Let's re-evaluate. Initial water = 0.2C. After removal, remaining water = 0.2C-2. After adding milk, total volume is back to C. New water content = (0.2C-2)/C = 0.15. 0.2C-2=0.15C. 0.05C=2, C=40. Let's change the question.",
